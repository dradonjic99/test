Evan edited this.

 

The .md stands for "markdown" which consists of a concise set of "markdown"
rules for formatting text.  So, in a normal text editor/reader, this looks OK,
but when the markdown tags are applied there is a little more formatting.

 

I downloaded a little md editor called Texts which is a WYSIWYG md interface
where formatting is done with ctrl sequences rather than with md tags.  For
example, the md tag for a 2nd level heading is "\#\# Blah Blah" and Texts builds
that automatically after one enters \<ctrl\>+2 (this toggles the heading):

 

\<ctrl\>+2
----------
